Forth language source code for Worms? by David S. Maynard, from David's original floppies. Available in two versions: Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64.

Atari 8-bit version: ATR format disk images. These FORTH disk images are not bootable; first load ValForth, available from http://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-400-800-xl-xe-valforth_17605.html, switch to a source disk, then type LIST [screen number]. I also exported the code into ASCII files for easier reading.

Commodore 64 version: D64 format disk image. This FORTH disk image is not bootable, and does not use a standard Commodore disk structure. (The EAFORTH and SYSTEM files are fake files.) This seems to use EA FORTH, which I'm guessing was a prorietary or custom version of the language used at Electronic Arts. We exported the code into an ASCII file for easier reading.

Disks provided to me by David, who has generously released the code with the MIT license.
